# State

State is managed using Redux to showcase direct changes

# Questions

Ques-1 - If a user can create and edit stages for a particular board. For example instead of Open > In Progress > Done if they want the stages of their task board to be Read > Working > Reviewing > Completed

Ans - It is possible to do, it works the same like editing a task, we can also add a functionality where a user can change the name of the card. Similarly we can create new cards too, like the way we are creating a task.

Ques-2 - If users can comment on tasks

Ans - It is also possible to do so, we only need to maintain user comments in an array, and we can map through that array to show all comments in a modal or somewhere when the show comments button is clicked.

Ques-3 - How will you do error handling?

Ans - Error handling can be managed in redux states or using try-catch block, if there is some error, we can notify the user via a alert or toast.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
